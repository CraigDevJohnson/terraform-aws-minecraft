2. Instance Outputs
   - Core EC2 instance details
   - IAM profile information
   - Public IP access details

3. Server Access Outputs
   - Minecraft server connection details
   - Pre-formatted for client use
   - Edition-specific port configuration

4. SSH Key Management
   - Both OpenSSH and PEM formats
   - Secure key handling with proper permissions
   - Connection string helper for different OS types

5. Storage and Monitoring
   - Backup bucket information
   - CloudWatch dashboard direct links
   - Performance monitoring access

### Output Security Considerations
- Private key marked as sensitive
- Public keys explicitly marked non-sensitive
- SSH connection strings templated by OS
- Proper file permissions for key storage

### Output Usage Examples
1. External Module Integration
```hcl
module "minecraft" {
  source = "path/to/module"
  # ...configuration...
}

resource "aws_route53_record" "minecraft" {
  zone_id = var.zone_id
  name    = "mc.example.com"
  type    = "A"
  ttl     = "300"
  records = [module.minecraft.instance_public_ip]
}
```

2. Backup Integration
```hcl
module "minecraft" {
  source = "path/to/module"
  # ...configuration...
}

resource "aws_backup_selection" "minecraft" {
  name = "minecraft-backup"
  backup_plan_id = aws_backup_plan.minecraft.id
  resources = [module.minecraft.instance_id]
}
```
